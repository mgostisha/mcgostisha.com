<InterestingReadsIntro
    customText="This one's all engineering and books. I've been going on social media less since my (former) platform of choice is in a rapid
    freefall towards death, so I haven't come across as many interesting things as I normally would. A generous colleague gave me a Bluesky invite that I've failed to do anything with,
    I tried Mastodon, I tried Threads, but really I just miss the little place that I'd created and I miss the things that I'd come across while browsing there. I should really give Bluesky a try,
    but to be honest I've quite enjoyed being on my phone less. /shrug"

I've read a lot of books since the last one. Goodreads says it's six. Some good, some bad, but two stood out.

<InterestingReadsArticle
    author="Hanif Abdurraqib"
    title="They Can't Kill Us Until They Kill Us"
    url="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33947154-they-can-t-kill-us-until-they-kill-us"

    This was my second read through of They Can't Kill Us Until They Kill Us. Hanif's writing is incredible and second only 
    to his ability to tell a story. I'd read him write about anything, which is my favorite thing about this book -- you get almost everything.
    Pop culture from the last millenium, inside looks at emo bands before they were popular, first-hand accounts of what it's like to be
    Black in a nearly all white city. Heavy at times, but appropriately, meaningfully heavy and beautiful cover to cover.

    I just really liked the setting and didn't really know what I was in for most of the time. It's vivid enough to pull you in and
    intriguing enough to not want to stop reading. Maybe it's because I hadn't loved the couple books I read before this, but damn if I didn't
    enjoy her writing style and seeing the environment unfold into the story.
